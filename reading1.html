  <h1>Reading Reflection</h1>
  <h2>Susan Sontang's On Photography</h2> 
  <p>The main takeaway that I had from the reading is that the main argument Sotang makes in “On Photography” is that people take photographs at face value, rather than considering any deeper meaning or context. 
People understand photographs as being a representation of what the world already is, which in her eyes can be exploitative as people don’t look to interpret or to gather more information about what they are looking at. 
This has also led to people becoming desensitized to issues due to the abundance of violent imagery. 
Considering this was written in 1977, the status of photography has changed drastically. People regard photography differently as an artform and have easier access to taking photos with the evolution of technology. 
Photography has become increasingly important in many factors of life, all with the intention of documenting something important and meaningful. 
Personally, I have very little experience taking photos through an artistic lens. 
I really only take photos of my family and friends. 
Beyond making sure they are in the center of the frame and are in focus, there really isn’t much artistic thought going into it for me. 
One concept of the reading that really interested me was Sotang’s explanation of how photography makes the mundane ‘beautiful’ versus making reality seem bland in comparison to a photo. 
There is an art to getting the ‘right’ shot, that is able to completely transform the look of a subject. 
This is something I hope to experiment with over the course of the semester. Especially in a city as unpredictable and chaotic as New York City. 
I really enjoy street photography as it usually best encapsulates the day to day lives of everyday people. 
There is so much to take away from a single shot of Times Square or Central Park, and it's even more fascinating to think about the lives and experiences people have within those shots. 
I also enjoy landscape photography, for similar reasons as street photography. It’s capturing a place in its most natural state. 
Furthermore it’s showcasing many of the wonders of the world, encouraging people like me to go and take pictures for myself. 
I really enjoy being out in nature and photography is really good at capturing the natural beauty of many places. 
Visually I love color, patterns and abstract art in general. I feel like with the current state of our world, I could create something visually stimulating.
 I think the type of tone I want to convey with my photos over the course of the semester is something a bit whimsical but with an underlying feeling of dread. 
I want to make sure the media I create pops in terms of color, but the content within the photo itself will vary. 
I am most excited about learning various editing techniques and being able to experiment with them. 
\I hope by the end of the semester there is a clear through line of what I wanted to get across in my photography and am able to push the limits of my creativity. </p>
